%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract} Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve the performances of models trained on a labeled source domain on unseen target domains, a task made difficult by differences in data distributions. One of the main approaches to UDA is to align source and target distributions in the feature space at training time. In this paper, we follow this approach and explore two main hypothesis: content-specific paths exist within a network, and discarding style-specific paths it's possible by performing simple Activation Shaping (ASH). ASH is the process of modifying activation maps from a layer within an architecture using either user-defined or learned rules. We conduct extensive experiments on the PACS dataset~\cite{Li}, using the Art paintings as source and the others as targets. Our results demonstrate that simple activation shaping can improve performances with the best overall results reaching an average improvement of up to 7\% (w.r.t to an unmodified baseline) in challenging domain shifts. These findings suggest that selectively operating on activation maps can effectively improve the learning of content-specific information, leading the way for the investigation of ASH for domain adaptation. Further exploration can be done on learning masking rules instead of defining them, selecting other static rules or dynamic and adaptive ones. We furthermore suggest to test this approach by injecting it into more sophisticated architectures already in place for domain adaptation. Implementation can be found at: \url{https://github.com/VincenzoDalia/AML_Project}.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro} A significant limitation of neural networks is their inability to perform well with any distribution met at test time. This is often referred to as the "Domain Shift" problem: training and test data often show significant differences resulting in a models with poor generalization capabilities. How can we train a model that is capable of generalizing to one or more domains that shifts from the training one? This challenge can be formalized with the UDA setting. UDA tackles the challenge of transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, effectively addressing the domain shift problem. Moreover, UDA is crucial in scenarios where obtaining labeled data or fine-tuning for the target domain is impractical or costly. Several state-of-the-art methods have been developed to address UDA, primarily falling into three main categories: adversarial learning, aligning feature spaces, and implicit representation learning~\cite{Liu},~\cite{Zhang}. 
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{pacs-uda.png}
   \caption{Unsupervised domain adpatation setting on the PACS dataset}
   \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}
Adversarial domain adaptation methods leverage adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between source and target domains by introducing a domain classifier that helps the model learn domain-invariant features. This approach employs a gradient reversal layer to ensure that the features learned by the model are indistinguishable between the source and target domains, effectively reducing the domain gap~\cite{Ganin}. Aligning feature space techniques, like Deep CORAL\cite{Sun} and MMD-based approaches\cite{Long},~\cite{Zhu}, seek to directly align the distributions of the feature representations from both domains. Deep CORAL works by aligning the second-order statistics (covariances) of the source and target features, while MMD-based methods measure and minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of the source and target features in kernel spaces. Learning implicit representations involves using self-supervised tasks tasks, such as solving jigsaw puzzles, predicting image rotations, or reconstruction tasks, to encourage the model to learn meaningful and invariant representations without requiring labeled data from the target domain~\cite{Xu}. These tasks are designed to capture the intrinsic properties of the data, enabling the model to generalize well to new, unseen domains. 


\subsection{Do content-specific paths exist?}
Our work falls into the feature space alignment category and focuses on building a simple and effective method based on the process of modifying activation maps from a layer within an architecture using user-defined rules (ASH). This strategy has been proven successful for Out-of-distribution detection (OOD) in~\cite{Djurisic}, which demonstrated the efficacy of simple activation modifications for identifying outliers and from which we took inspiration for our domain adaptation setting. Our research explores two main questions: do content-specific paths exist within neural networks?, are we able to find them with ease? We hypothesize that simple ASH can effectively isolate content-specific features within a network with very small computational and train overhead. Our approach involves two main strategies: using random activation masks (RA) to disrupt style-specific information, and domain adaptation shaping (DA), that consists in aligning source and target activations by performing binarization and simple element-wise multiplication. Additionally, we use regularization techniques such as top-K activation retention and epsilon smoothing to improve robustness and gradient flow.

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
it says that you are building on her work.
If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.
An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
   Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

You can handle this paper like any other.
Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
Instead write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
   This system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
   Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
   It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...

FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
Thus, the following is correct:
   ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.

The total allowable size of the text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54 cm) high.
Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them.
The main title (on the first page) should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page.
The second and following pages should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge.
On all pages, the bottom margin should be $1\frac{1}{8}$ inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper;
for A4 paper, approximately $1\frac{5}{8}$ inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area $6\frac{7}{8}$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac{7}{8}$ inches (22.54 cm)
high.
%
Page numbers should be in the footer, centered and $\frac{3}{4}$ inches from the bottom of the page.
The review version should have page numbers, yet the final version submitted as camera ready should not show any page numbers.
The \LaTeX\ template takes care of this when used properly.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.
If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE.
Center the title $1\frac{3}{8}$ inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the first page.
The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs;
do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
Leave two blank lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type.
This information is to be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT.
Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced.
Do NOT use double-spacing.
All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.~$\frac{1}{6}$ inch or 0.422 cm).
Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left and flush right.
Please do not place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short}.
Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements}) should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after.
If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote{This is what a footnote looks like.
It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).
If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced.
Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cross-references}

For the benefit of author(s) and readers, please use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}  command for cross-referencing to figures, tables, equations, or sections.
This will automatically insert the appropriate label alongside the cross-reference as in this example:
\begin{quotation}
  To see how our method outperforms previous work, please see \cref{fig:onecol} and \cref{tab:example}.
  It is also possible to refer to multiple targets as once, \eg~to \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short-a}.
  You may also return to \cref{sec:formatting} or look at \cref{eq:also-important}.
\end{quotation}
If you do not wish to abbreviate the label, for example at the beginning of the sentence, you can use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \Cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}
command. Here is an example:
\begin{quotation}
  \Cref{fig:onecol} is also quite important.
\end{quotation}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the end of your paper.
When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.
Where appropriate, include page numbers and the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
When you cite multiple papers at once, please make sure that you cite them in numerical order like this \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Alpher05,Authors14b,Authors14}.
If you use the template as advised, this will be taken care of automatically.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
    \toprule
    Method & Frobnability \\
    \midrule
    Theirs & Frumpy \\
    Yours & Frobbly \\
    Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
  \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.
In \LaTeX, avoid using the \texttt{center} environment for this purpose, as this adds potentially unwanted whitespace.
Instead use
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \centering
\end{verbatim}}
at the beginning of your figure.
Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.
Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths that render effectively in print.
Readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic copy, may choose to print your paper in order to read it.
You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a discussion of the use of color in your document.

If you use color in your plots, please keep in mind that a significant subset of reviewers and readers may have a color vision deficiency; red-green blindness is the most frequent kind.
Hence avoid relying only on color as the discriminative feature in plots (such as red \vs green lines), but add a second discriminative feature to ease disambiguation.
